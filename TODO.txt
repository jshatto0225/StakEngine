-- Fix Logging

-- Look into reducing number of globals. Possible by consolidating them into one _SKApplciation struct created in EntryPoint.h
	-- Try to get application to support local structs (Fix on_event and add_layer)

-- Also try to include all libs in repo since cmake is annoying

-- Consider changine win32 poll events to not use while loop or move to different thread
